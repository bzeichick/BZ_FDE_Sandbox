# Glossary

Every term introduced across the ten weeks of **The AI Forward-Deployed
Engineer Certification**, collected alphabetically. Each week's README also
defines its own terms in context — this file is the cross-week index.

| Term | The one-sentence version | Where it bites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A schema as a contract** | The same type definition used by the API, the tests, and the eval harness, so they cannot disagree | S2 discussion, and TC1 Step 5 |
| **Agent vs. pipeline** | An agent decides its own next step; a pipeline follows the steps you wrote | S2 discussion, which is the argument of that session, and TC1 Step 6 |
| **CA bundle** | The list of authorities your tools trust; Python's is not your operating system's | The remediation you will need if Task 1 shows your employer's name |
| **Generated artifacts** | A file built from another file is never hand-edited or hand-merged — it is regenerated | S1 Task 2, and the only correct way to resolve an `.ipynb` conflict |
| **Golden examples** | Inputs paired with outputs a human judged correct, written before any system exists | S2 discussion, and TC1 Step 7 |
| **origin and upstream** | Your fork is where you push; the course repository is where you pull updates from. Different remotes, different jobs | S1 Task 2 |
| **Provider abstraction** | One calling convention over many model vendors, so the vendor is a config value | S1 Task 4 |
| **TLS and certificate chains** | Your client trusts a server because a certificate authority it already trusts signed that server's certificate | S1 Task 1 — the "Signed by" column |
| **TLS interception** | A corporate proxy terminates your encrypted connection, reads it, and re-signs it with the firm's own CA | S1 Task 1, and every failed `pip install` for the rest of your career |
| **Unit economics** | Cost per request × requests, against the cost of the work being replaced | S2 discussion, and TC1 Step 13 |
